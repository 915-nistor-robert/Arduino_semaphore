# Arduino_semaphore

Here I made a working semphore using arduino.

The semaphore for the cars will stay red until the button is pressed by a pedestrian, after that a short timer will begin
and the semaphore will turn red for the cars and green for the pedestrian. After about 30 seconds the semaphore will go back at beign red at pedestrians
and green for the cars.
